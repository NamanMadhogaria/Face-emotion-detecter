😊 Face Emotion Detection
This project is a real-time Face Emotion Detection System that detects human facial expressions from live webcam feed or images using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It classifies emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Neutral, etc., based on facial features.

🚀 Features
Detects faces from webcam or image input

Classifies emotions using a trained CNN model

Real-time video feed emotion detection using OpenCV

Simple and intuitive interface to visualize predictions

Can be extended to work with images or videos from file

🧠 Model Overview
Face Detection: Performed using Haar cascades or Dlib/MediaPipe/OpenCV DNN face detectors

Emotion Classification: CNN-based classifier trained on a facial expression dataset such as FER2013
